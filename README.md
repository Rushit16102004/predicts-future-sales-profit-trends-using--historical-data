# üìà Future Sales Trends Prediction using Historical Data
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to predict future sales trends using historical profit data from a sample superstore dataset. The prediction is performed using the Prophet library, a forecasting tool developed by Facebook.

# üåü Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to leverage historical sales and profit data to forecast future trends. This can be crucial for businesses to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, marketing strategies, and resource allocation. The project utilizes the Prophet library, which is known for its ability to handle time series data with trends, seasonality, and holidays.

# üìä Dataset
The analysis is performed on a dataset named Sample - Superstore.csv. This dataset contains various columns related to sales transactions, including:

* Order Date: The date of the order.

* Profit: The profit generated from the order.

* Other relevant columns like Row ID, Order ID, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment, Country, City, State, Postal Code, Region, Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name, Sales, and Quantity.

The notebook specifically focuses on the Order Date and Profit columns for time series forecasting.

# üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies
To run this notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

* pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

* matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.

* prophet: Facebook's forecasting tool for time series data.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

	pip install pandas matplotlib prophet

Note: You might encounter a TqdmWarning related to IProgress and ipywidgets if you don't have them updated. While not critical for the notebook's core functionality, updating them can improve the interactive plot experience. Also, "Importing plotly failed. Interactive plots will not work." suggests that plotly might be missing or not correctly installed if you intend to use interactive plots. The current notebook uses matplotlib.

# üöÄ Usage
* Clone the repository:

		git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME

* Ensure you have the dataset:
Place the Sample - Superstore.csv file in a directory named Data within your cloned repository, i.e., YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/Data/Sample - Superstore.csv.

* Open the Jupyter Notebook:

		jupyter notebook "future sales trends using-profit historical data.ipynb"

* Run the cells:
Execute the cells sequentially to see the data loading, preprocessing, and profit prediction steps.

# üîç Analysis and Results
The notebook performs the following key steps:

* Data Import: Loads the Sample - Superstore.csv dataset.

* Data Exploration: Displays the head and tail of the dataset to understand its structure.

* Profit Data Preparation:

* * Extracts Order Date and Profit columns into a new DataFrame dfP.

* * Plots the raw Profit data over time to visualize initial trends.

* * Renames columns to ds (datestamp) and y (value) as required by the Prophet library.

* * Further data cleaning and aggregation steps are expected to prepare the data for Prophet (e.g., converting 'ds' to datetime objects, aggregating profit by date if multiple entries exist for the same date).

The output plots show the historical profit trends. The subsequent steps in the notebook (not fully detailed in the provided snippet but implied by the project title) would involve:

* Converting the 'ds' column to datetime objects.

* Aggregating profit by date (e.g., summing daily profits) to create a single time series.

* Initializing and fitting the Prophet model.

* Making future predictions.

* Visualizing the forecasts, including trends and seasonality components.

# ‚ú® Future Enhancements
* Sales Prediction: Extend the analysis to predict sales trends in addition to profit.

* Granular Analysis: Perform predictions at a more granular level (e.g., by product category, region, or customer segment).

* Holiday Effects: Incorporate holiday effects into the Prophet model for more accurate predictions.

* Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize Prophet model parameters for better forecasting performance.

* Interactive Visualizations: Use plotly or other interactive libraries to create more engaging and insightful plots.

* Model Evaluation: Implement metrics to evaluate the accuracy of the forecasting model.
